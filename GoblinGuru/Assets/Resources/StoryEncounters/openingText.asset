  text: "Yours is a poor life, going from place to place trying to get food and shelter.
    From a young age you\u2019ve looked different to most of the others you meet:
    smaller, uglier, stupider and poorer. One day you were just too hungry, and no
    one would let your starving self have food so you stole it.\r\n\r\nFor a moment
    it seemed to work without a hitch, until you bumped into one of your only true
    friends named Arizta. It was nice to see her, a fellow goblin like yourself but
    it was at the wrong moment.\r\n\r\nThe food fell out, and as you scrambled to
    put it back in guards were summoned. You panicked, dragging Arizta with you, the
    nearest safe place to lose them for sure would be the swamp.\r\n\r\nYou set off,
    pursuit hot on your heels.\r\n"
